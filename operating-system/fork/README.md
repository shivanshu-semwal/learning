# `fork`

- syscall
- create a duplicate of parent process to create a child process
- uses COW - copy on write mechanism so as to prevent waste of resources
    - COW means that when some data is changed only then a new copy is created for the child process for that data


## COW - Copy on write

- Initial Forking:
    - When a process calls `fork()`, instead of creating an immediate duplicate of the process's address space (which can be very memory-intensive), the operating system sets up both the parent and the child process to share the same physical memory pages.
    - Both processes' page tables (which map virtual memory to physical memory) point to the same physical memory pages.
- Marking Pages as Read-Only:
    - The shared pages are marked as read-only. This is a critical part of the mechanism because it ensures that any attempt to modify these pages triggers a page fault.
- Page Fault Handling:
    - If either the parent or the child process attempts to write to a shared page, a page fault occurs because the page is marked as read-only.
    - The operating system then handles this page fault by creating a private copy of the page for the process attempting the write operation. This private copy is writable, while the original page remains shared and read-only for the other process.
- Updating Page Tables:
    - The page table of the process that caused the page fault is updated to point to the new private copy of the page. The other processâ€™s page table still points to the original shared page.
